This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to cybersecurity, focusing on network traffic classification for intrusion detection. It compares supervised learning models like Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Decision Trees (DT), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) across benchmark datasets such as CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15. The research aims to enhance threat detection accuracy, minimize false positives, and optimize resource use in cybersecurity operations.

## Actions
We downloaded the CICIDS2017 benchmark dataset, which contains diverse network traffic files, including DDoS, PortScan, Infiltration, Web Attacks, and regular working-hour traffic. To ensure balanced and manageable processing, we randomly sampled 31,437 instances from each file before concatenating them into a unified dataset.
