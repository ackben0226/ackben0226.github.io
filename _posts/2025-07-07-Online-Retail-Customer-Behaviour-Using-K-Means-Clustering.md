# Customer Segmentation for Retail Growth | K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview  
In this project we are going to leverage RFM analysis and K-Means Clustering to optimize marketing ROI for a retail growth.
The goal is to uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior and derive actionable business insights to help drive targeted marketing, customer retention, and sales growth strategies.

## üéØ Business Impact Highlights
- **27% Revenue Concentration** in High-Value Cluster (5% of customer base)
- **Identified 18% At-Risk Customers** with Reactivation Potential
- **Built Dynamic Segmentation Framework** Reducing Campaign Costs by 32% (Simulated)
- **Enabled Personalized Marketing** Through 4 Distinct Behavioral Profiles

## Action

## üîç Technical Implementation
### üìä Data Pipeline Architecture

## üîß Core Components
### 1. Data Preparation
   - Processed 541,909 transactions from UK retailer
   - Handled 24.9% missing CustomerIDs
   - Detected & treated outliers using IQR ranges
     
### 2. RFM Feature Engineering
We will create features that form the basis of RFM analysis (*Recency, Frequency, Monetary*) and *Total Revenue*, and are needed for K-Means clustering and business decision-making.
```ruby
# Creating column for total sale of each line
data['TotalSale'] = data['Quantity'] * data['UnitPrice']
```

```python
# Calculate Frequency and Monetary Values of customers
agg_data = cleaned_data.groupby(by = 'CustomerID', as_index = False) \
    .agg(MonetaryValue = ('TotalSale', 'sum'),           # Monetary
        Frequency = ('Invoice No', 'nunique'),            # Frequency
        LastInvoiceDate = ('Invoice Date', 'max'))        

# Calculate Recency of Customers
max_invoice_date = agg_data['LastInvoiceDate'].max()
agg_data['Recency'] = (max_invoice_date - agg_data['LastInvoiceDate']).dt.days
```

### 3. Machine Learning Workflow (Optimal K)
```ruby
# Assuming non_outliers_scaled is already defined
max_k = 12
inertia = []
silhouette_scores = []  # Create a list to store silhouette scores
k_values = range(2, max_k + 1)

for k in k_values:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42, max_iter=1000)
    
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(non_outliers_scaled)
    
    # Calculate and store the silhouette score
    sil_score = silhouette_score(non_outliers_scaled, cluster_labels)
    silhouette_scores.append(sil_score)
    
    # Store inertia values
    inertia.append(kmeans.inertia_)
```
We need to find the optimal k (number of clusters) that best separates your customers based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary behavior. This is done using the above syntax before proceeding with the Elbow Method visualization.

### Cluster Label
To identify customers such as high-value loyal customers, at-risk customers, and one-time buyers, K-Means clustering uses RFM scores (numerical values) to group customers into clusters and, hence labeled as either **re-engage, retain, delight, reward, etc.** based on similarities in their purchasing behavior. Each customer is assigned to the cluster whose centroid best represents their RFM profile.
We visualize a 3-dimensional scatter plot for the clusters to provide a better understanding of these segments, with Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value on each axis.

```ruby
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 4, random_state = 42, max_iter = 1000)
cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(non_outliers_scaled)
cluster_labels

# 3-Dimensional Scatterplot for CustomerID
cluster_colors = {0 : 'blue', 1 : 'green', 2 : 'orange', 3 : 'red'}
colors = non_outliers['Cluster'].map(cluster_colors)

fig = plt.figure(figsize = (10, 10))
ax = fig.add_subplot(projection = '3d')
scatter = ax.scatter(non_outliers['MonetaryValue'],
                     non_outliers['Frequency'],
                     non_outliers['Recency'],
                    c = colors, marker = 'o')

ax.set_xlabel('Monetary Value')
ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
ax.set_zlabel('Recency')

ax.set_title('3D Scatter Plot of Customer Data by Clusters')
plt.show()
```

The table below shows a sample of customers segmented using RFM scores and K-Means clustering. Each customer is assigned a Cluster number and a corresponding ClusterLabel that describes their segment based on purchasing behavior.
